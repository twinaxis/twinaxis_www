# Welcome!
TwinAxis came out of mainly boredom and apathy. In the last few
months (most of January of 2002 and the first week of Febuary),
we finally decided to get us a 'permanent' web presence. And here
it is.

# The Past
Previously, we've been known (or have little been known) as StealthTeam.
StealthTeam started out as a silly Film Production Studio, which
produced titles such as, "More Dull Combat" and "Fists and Steel". As 
the years passed, things have progressed into Programming, and Writing. 
And here we are.

# The Future
The future is unknown. And insane. Oh well.
